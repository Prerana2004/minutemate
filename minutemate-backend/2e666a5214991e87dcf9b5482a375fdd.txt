Welcome to the monthly planning meeting. Good morning everyone. The deadline for the UI prototype is this Friday. It's really urgent and we need to finish it ASAP. Raj will take action on the feedback we received. One important thing, we must not forget the client presentation next week. Let's schedule a follow-up meeting on Wednesday to check on this task.
