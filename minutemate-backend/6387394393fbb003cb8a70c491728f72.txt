Welcome to the monthly planning meeting. We have completed over 70% of our project.
The deadline for submitting the prototype is Friday. We have decided to launch the project by
Sunday. It's really urgent and we need to finish it aside. Raj will take action on the feedback.
One important thing, let's schedule a follow-up for Wednesday to track this task. Thank you.
